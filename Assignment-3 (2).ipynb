If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n","\n","```\n","ssh myserver -L 8888:localhost:8888\n","```\n","\n","The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n","Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n","later in this appendix.\n","\n","### Timing\n","\n","We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n","Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n","\n","```\n","pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n","jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n","jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime\n","```\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","* Using the Jupyter Notebook tool, we can edit, run, and contribute to each section of the book.\n","* We can run Jupyter notebooks on remote servers using port forwarding.\n","\n","\n","## Exercises\n","\n","1. Edit and run the code in this book with the Jupyter Notebook on your local machine.\n","1. Edit and run the code in this book with the Jupyter Notebook *remotely* via port forwarding.\n","1. Compare the running time of the operations $\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ for two square matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{1024 \\times 1024}$.
